# ALX Project 0x00 – Next.js Setup

This project is part of the ALX Front-End track. It is a basic setup of a modern web application using **Next.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**. It aims to help junior developers (like me!) understand how to configure and start a Next.js project.

- ✅ Next.js (React-based framework)
